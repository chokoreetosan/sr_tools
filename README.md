Some tools for ShadowRun 5th edition.  Currently just my dice roller.
Will be writing a bot for slack that uses it.
Other tools to come.

For slack_roller.py you will need to create the channel #shadowrun and replace the values for:
request.form['token']
url
as those are provided for you by slack.

hero_lab contains .user files for some of the tm rules located in tm_house_rules.txt
